# py3console
A Python 3+/Win10 port of Fredrik Lundh's Console module (http://effbot.org/zone/console-index.htm). It is currently working enough for my purposes (to use on my rlRPG Balance) so I'm stopping work on that for the moment. Please feel free to comment and improve my hacking job on this if you see a reason for it.
